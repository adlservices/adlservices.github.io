        <div class="step">
            <p><strong>Make sure to do these steps in actual phone browser like Safari - not snap browser</strong></p>
            <p>1. First, head to <a href="https://altstore.io/" target="_blank">AltStore</a></p>
            <p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoSAUmjvk0E" target="_blank">youtube video</a> if you're having trouble installing.</p>
            <p><strong>This step is done on your pc or mac, just download the relevant altserver version.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>2. Next, download this IPA file on your phone:</p>
            <p><a href="https://programleg.github.io/apps/older/mySAGOV.ipa" target="_blank">Download IPA File</a></p>
            <p>If it comes up with Untrusted Developer warning, go to Settings, then General and scroll down to Device Management then trust the developer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>3. Open AltStore on your phone and go to the apps tab. Click on the plus button and find your mySAGOV.ipa file, then tap it. It should start installing.</p>
            <p><strong>Make sure your iphone is still connected to your mac and Altserver is running.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>4. The app should then give you a code. Send me your code and I'll unlock it remotely, bump messages if I don't reply. You should now be able to unlock the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>5. Click this <a href="https://adlservices.github.io/config.html" target="_blank">link</a> and enter the relevant details, make sure to follow the examples. Your Card ID Number can be your real one if you want.</p>
            <p>Next, press click to confirm details and then download your config file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>6. Now go to your 'Downloads' folder in Files and copy the file called 'config.json'. Rename it if you have to. Then go out and paste the 'config.json' file into the 'mySAGOV' folder.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>7. Find a photo for your ID photo. It's best if it's a portrait photo of you with a white background, 500x500 pixels. In the camera roll, share the photo and 'Save to Files'. Save it to the 'mySAGOV' folder then rename it as 'portrait.jpg'.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <p>8. Relaunch the app and everything should be good! Swipe up the MySAGOV app then reopen it.</p>
        </div>
        <footer>
            <p>Also, because of Apple's regulations, the app has to be refreshed every 7 days. You can simply do this by reconnecting your phone to your computer and reinstalling Altstore through Altserver on your computer. Takes like 5 mins.</p>
